# Ainalyzer
A Go game review helper app

Ainalyzer is an app designed to help you review game with any open-source AI that can use the gtp protocol.

## State

This is still in its early stage and for the moment you can't use any AI yet.

Some basic sgf editing tools are working (open/save sgf, variations).


## Controls

`q` close the app

`o` open a sgf

`s` save the current sgf

`n` new file

Use the left and right arrows and/or the mouse wheel to traverse the sgf.

## Install

Using cargo you can launch AInalyzer with `cargo run --release`

If you want to install a binary use `cargo install --path=./`
